/fork of [[https://github.com/13-CF/afetch][afetch]]*/

* Why fork to bfetch?

I dunno, it was an excuse to learn more C. I plan to incorporate more
BSD-specific things, such as OpenBSD's
[[https://man.openbsd.org/pledge][pledge(4)]], or fetching boot
environment backup information on FreeBSD. Things of that nature.

This fetch program seemed pretty well written, good job 13-CF, and
contributors! I don't plan to PR any of this stuff back into afetch.
This is my attempt at a serious independent project.

** Requirements

+ A C compiler
+ A compatible C standard library implementation
+ pthreads

** Systems supported

+ FreeBSD
+ NetBSD
+ OpenBSD

** Configuration options

+ Custom text for each seperate row of info
+ Force upper/lowercase text
+ Option to print colour blocks, and choose a character for the block
+ More to be implemented soon

*TODO*
- Create CONFIG.org file with in depth guide to customisation 
- Incorporate OpenBSD's [[https://man.openbsd.org/pledge][pledge(4)]] 
- Add more BSD-Specific features, such as boot environment backup
- information on FreeBSD targets, bhyve/vmm guest system resource usage.
